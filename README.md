I'm a passionate front-end developer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. With 3 years of experience, I thrive on turning creative ideas into interactive and user-friendly web experiences using JavaScript as my main language. 

While my expertise lies in front-end development, I also bring a solid background in back-end and mobile development to the table. This diverse skill set allows me to approach projects with a holistic perspective, ensuring seamless integration across various platforms.

Currently, I'm delving into the exciting world of Cloud Computing, with a focus on earning my first certification from AWS.
